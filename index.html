    <p>Q: Whoâ€™s your favorite character from a book, show, game, etc?</p>

    <p>Q: What's your favorite dessert?</p>

It's mint ice cream with white chocolate chip and while it doesn't seem like it would be much of a change from mint with regular chocolate chip, the white chocolate made all the difference. The flavor was only for a limited time and I'm really hoping they bring it back.</p>
